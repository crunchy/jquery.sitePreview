jquery.sitePreview
======

This is a very simple and currently single purpose widget
for our homepage.

It's made to create a sort of "feature preview" site banner to give us
a way to give people a preview of our site and functionality via a scrolling
image/html markup container.

It needs a lot of work to abstract and allow for more configurability on the
JS side and some styling work to make it look nice.

For an examples, see the `examples` directory.
